# RustLife
Yet another implementation of Conway's Game of Life. I'm currently learning Rust, so this is a little project I'm making to help with that. Don't expect this application to be particularly useful or good!

## Controls
Currently, key bindings are hardcoded. They are:
* SPACEBAR - Pause/unpause the simulation
* S - Step the simulation while paused
* R - Reinitialize the simulation with a random state

## Special thanks
RustLife is built using PixelGameEngine. Thanks to [javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) for making the original, and to [Matthew Bettcher](https://github.com/mattbettcher) for porting it to Rust!
